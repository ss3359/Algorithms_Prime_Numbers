# Algorithms_Prime_Numbers
This is a repository dedicating to everything that has to do with Prime Numbers. This will start with using The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers less than a given number. Then I will update this repository of more algorithms using prime numbers. I hope you like this. Thank you for visiting
